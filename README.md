JavaScript programs are mysterious and hidden realms where magic happens. 

This can be delightful when everything is working. 

During development, though, things often won't work so well, and understanding why can be hard. 

You need a way to dispell the fog and see everything clearly. 

In this workshop we'll learn how to use a tool that professionals rely on to get crucial insights into their JavaScript programs: Chrome's Developer Tools (DevTools). 

With DevTools, you can get amazing access to the inner workings of your program while it runs, controlling how it executes with fine-grained control. 

This means that once you learn the DevTools arts, you can find and fix problems in a snap!
